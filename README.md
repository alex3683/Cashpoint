The Cashpoint app is mainly a simple project to play a bit with new technologies like nodejs, mongodb and nowjs and become more familiar with new HTML5 apis. By sharing this on github others may learn from what I'm learning, give feedback or perhaps even contribute things.

# Attention:

This project is in its early beginnings and far from being done.

# Dependencies:

- connect
